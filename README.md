# Crime-in-LA
The dataset illustrates the degree of severity that the LA crime possesses. The data drills down on the victimÂ´s characteristics, crime's nature, weapons used, location and more importantly, the current status of the reported cases.

With the objective to assist the LA Police Department and in turn, curb down the crime rate in LA, the team will conduct granular, descriptive and prescriptive analysis and in turn, provide actionable insights and recommendations to accomplish the objective.
